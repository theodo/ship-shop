#Getting Started with Platform.sh and Ship-Shop
Welcome to the world of Platform.sh and Ship-Shop! This guide will walk you through the steps to set up a new project on Platform.sh and use the Ship-Shop template.

##Step 1: Open Platform.sh
Start by navigating to platform.sh and creating an account if you haven't already.

##Step 2: Create a New Project
Once you have an account, click the "Create from Scratch" button and give your project a name (e.g. myprojectname). Select the region as "France".

##Step 3: Clone the Template
Before you can use the Ship-Shop template, you need to clone it. If you haven't already, follow these steps:

##Go to the Ship-Shop repository on Github.
Click the "Use this template" green button.
Create a new repository on Github using this template.
##Step 4: Set Up Github Integration
To integrate your new project with Github, follow these steps:

Click the gear icon (settings) on your Platform.sh project page.
Go to the "Integrations" section.
Click on "Github integration".
Generate a new token on Github with the scopes read:org, repo, and admin:repo:hook. Make sure to save this token in a safe place, such as Dashlane.
Enter the token on the Platform.sh integration step and select your project.
##Step 5: Wait and Check the URL
After completing all the steps, wait for about 30 minutes. You can then check the URL of your project, which will be available on the left side of the project page on Platform.sh.

Congratulations, you now have a new project on Platform.sh using the Ship-Shop template!
